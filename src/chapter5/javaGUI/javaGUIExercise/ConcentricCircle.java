/*5.1
    Draw 12 concentric circles in the center of a JPanel (Fig. 5.29). The innermost circle
    should have a radius of 10 pixels, and each successive circle should have a radius 10 pixels larger than
    the previous one. Begin by finding the center of the JPanel . To get the upper-left corner of a circle,
    move up one radius and to the left one radius from the center. The width and height of the bound-
    ing rectangle are both the same as the circleâ€™s diameter (i.e., twice the radius).*/

    /*5.2
        Modify Exercise 5.16 from the end-of-chapter exercises to read input using dialogs and to
        display the bar chart using rectangles of varying lengths.
